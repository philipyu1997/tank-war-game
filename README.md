## Overview
### Description

Tank War is a 2D multiplayer game where two tanks are fighting against one another. In order to defeat your opponent and win the game, you would need to strategize a plan and take advantage of the power ups that are spawned all across the map. Use the wide map to your advantage and dodge enemy attacks using the wall blocks that are set in place.
